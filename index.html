          A Leo born in 1996 falls under the Chinese Zodiac sign of the Fire
          Rat. This pairing results in a personality that is typically
          ambitious, intelligent, charming, and highly energetic, but who might
          need help managing their intense emotions and avoiding burnout. The
          Fire element enhances Leo's natural enthusiasm but also brings
          intensity to the Rat's quick, clever mind.Garnet Grounding, Passion,
          and Emotional Stability Aligns with the Fire element while providing
          grounding. It stabilizes the Rat's quick, sometimes anxious energy and
          enhances Leo's courage.
